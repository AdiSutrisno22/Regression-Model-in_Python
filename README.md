# Regression Model in Python
## Boston Housing Data

Project Description
- Import package 
- Load Data Project
- Split data Train -Validate - Testing
- Calculate VIF score :
  1. Perform feature selection on highly correlated fetures
  2. Draw Heat Map correlation
  3. Drop Multicollinear features
- Train Multiple Model with different alpha (lambda)
  1. Ridge Model Regression
  2. Lasso Model Regression
- Choose the best lambda from validation dataset nby RMSE value
- Interpret a sampel of the coefficient of the best model
- Model Evaluation
  1. Ridge best model
  2. Lasso best model
- Diagnostic Study
- Training Error
- Testing Error
- Conclusion
